# [!Bored](https://johnparkerhodges.github.io/Bored/)

## Description
The purpose of this project was to utilize a new CSS framework that we haven't used in the past (so not Bootstrap) and server-side APIs to create an interactive application of our choosing that addresses a problem.

Class concepts: Teamwork in Agile Web Development, Server-Side APIs, CSS Frameworks, Using GitHub with multiple contributors

User story:
> As a member of my community,
> I want to be able to find various things to do,
> so that I can fully enjoy living here.

We chose the following framework and APIs:
1. Material Design for Bootstrap(MDB)
2. Google Maps: Places API & Maps API
3. Eventful
4. Ticketmaster

!Bored allows the user to input their location by allowing the application to grab geolocation or typing in a zip code and then display all events in that location within 24 hours to solve their boredom.

**For extra features we added:**
- Ability to filter events by the categories of Shows, Sports, Festivals, Music, Movies, and Food.
- User Profiles with the ability to sign in, choose a visual theme for the site, saved

## Challenges
- Focusing on the MVP...lots of time spent on the functionality of icebox features.
-
